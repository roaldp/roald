name: code_formatting
description: Reformat code for readability without changing behaviour: clear names, simple control flow, no unnecessary fallbacks, errors raised plainly.
when_to_use: Use when the user asks to clean up, tidy or format code, or when a file is hard to read and the task is readability rather than behaviour.

## GUIDE: Coding Practices for Typescript

Format the code such that it is easy to read for a junior developer. Make sure to keep functionality the same, except if stated otherwise. Keep code simple, do not use fallbacks except if the user requests this, prefer raising errors in a simple way. Do not overcomplicate, simple is best.


## Coding Rules

- use JSDoc, including the params with a short explanation and what the function returns
- use interface for data transfer objects when data needs to be passed between classes. Where applicable, the result of a function should be an (updated) DTO.
- use dependency injection to inject instances of other classes that are needed
- prioritize readability
- Each function or class method should do only one specific job. Instead of a single processData method that both validates and saves, you should have a validateData method and a separate saveData method. This makes your code easier to test, reuse, and reason about. Keep readability as the top priority and avoid over-modularizing.
- Be explicit: always define the types for function parameters and return values. Use specific types instead of any (or use interface where logical)
- Where a block of code is complex, use comments (//) to annotate the steps. Prefer simple, readable code over clever but confusing optimizations unless performance is a critical, stated requirement.
- Add constants at the top of the file for things that the user indicates they would like to change or are often repeated. Do not overdo this.
- No Emoji's
- NO OVERENGINEERING, NO FALLBACKS
- For not implemented features, throw an error, do not implement fallbacks or hardcode responses.
- Fail fast, throw errors immediately if values are not as expected.
- Create code sections MAIN HANDLERS / ENDPOINTS / MAIN ENTRYPOINTS / ... (depends on the situation), and HELPER FUNCTIONS. Put the MAIN HANDLERS (or equivalent) at the top of the file
- Add a description of what the file does. This should first be a short, human-readable summary to understand it, followed by a couple bullet points with the responsibilities


## Naming Conventions

- **Component files**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx`)
- **Component names**: Use PascalCase (e.g., `const MyComponent = () => {...}`)
- **Props**: Use camelCase (e.g., `onClick`, `backgroundColor`)
- **Variable names**: Use camelCase (e.g., `userProfile`, `setIsLoading`)
- **Custom hooks**: Start with "use" (e.g., `useWindowSize`)


## Code sections example
// ============================================================================
// SECTION NAME
// ============================================================================

Common sections for backend files
- constants
- helper files
- entry point
- main logic

Common sections for frontend files
- constants
- event handlers (possibly header per group of event handlers)
- components
- render
